# HPCC-ECL-Hackathon-2023

This hackathon is called as Find your Paradise, which means we need to find a best state in USA which is like a paradise to live in.
We were given three datasets namely Crime, Education, Health and Weather Datasets of USA. We cleaned those datasets and gave scores to each state based on their data.
Next we gave a Paradise score which takes into consideration of all the individual scores of each state and gives us which state is a Paradise to live in.
